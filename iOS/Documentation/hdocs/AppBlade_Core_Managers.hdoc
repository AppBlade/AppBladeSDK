  @discussion Core Managers provide complex but categorizable behavior that, without their inclusion, would cause AppBlade to not work. 

		They mostly revolve around Device and Application information, and are separated for both readability and independent use. 

		The Application and Device information that we retrieve could be useful for reasons specific to your project, feel free to use it through our managers.
		
		Our core is divided into the following verticals, with a manager for each :
		  <ul>
		  <li> @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBApplicationInfoManager Application Info (APBApplicationInfoManager) @/link </li>
		  <li> @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBDeviceInfoManager Device Info (APBDeviceInfoManager) @/link </li>
		  <li> @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBTokenManager Token Management (APBTokenManager) @/link </li>
		  </ul>
		
		@note In addition to the Core Managers, you should also familiarize yourself with the core classes that are not delegated to managers if you are planning on epanding the framework, namely the @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBWebOperation Web Operations @/link, the @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBSimpleKeychain AppBlade Simple Keychain @/link, and the  @link //apple_ref/occ/cl/APBFileMD5Hash File Hashing class @/link
