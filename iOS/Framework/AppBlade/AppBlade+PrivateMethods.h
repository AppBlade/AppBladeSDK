 <li> AppBladeWebClientAPI_AllTypes returns current number of all pending/sending web requests. Essentially the size of the queue.</li>

 Note that in the AppBlade singleton this returns the calls in the queue regardless of state. APBWebOperations only leave the queue once they finish their webcall and execute any completion blocks they have. The number represented in this return value is therefore inclusive to both the running, yet-to-run, and finishing Web Operations. More logic would be required to distinguish calls with more granularity, though that is currently not necessarry anywhere.
