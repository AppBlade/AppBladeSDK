 <ul>

     <li> AppBladeWebClientAPI_AllTypes returns current number of all pending/sending web requests. Essentially the size of the queue.</li>

 Note that in the AppBlade singleton this returns the calls in the queue regardless of state. APBWebOperations only leave the queue once they finish their webcall and execute any completion blocks they have. The number represented in this return value is therefore inclusive to both the running, yet-to-run, and finishing Web Operations. More logic would be required to distinguish calls with more granularity, though that is currently not necessarry anywhere.

 @class APBWebOperation
 @discussion The main class for all web operations. Each APBWebOperation object is to be considered a single webrequest (single GET/POST/PUT) that pends in a queue if too many requests were called in front of it.
 For more complicated web activities (like a conditional second web request on a failure), web operations can be queued or called from inside feature manager web-handling methods.
 Completion, success, and failure blocks should be used whenever possible.
