The AppBlade Source Example Android project demonstrates the AppBladeSDK  features as exhaustively as possible. Make sure a copy of the AppBlade Framework source code is also imported into your workspace. Follow our online documentation for instructions on embedding our SDK if you're not sure about something (https://github.com/AppBlade/SDK/wiki/Embedding-our-SDK).  


To demo this example for yourself:
1. Register a project on AppBlade.
2. Embed your AppBlade credentials  
3. Build and upload your .apk to AppBlade
4. Make a change to the Update Example project (editing android:versionName in the manifest will work best as that value is being read and displayed already).
5. Build and upload your second .apk to AppBlade.

If you had a device that downloaded the build uploaded to AppBlade after step 3, then after step 5 resuming the build will prompt an update to be downloaded to that devices downloads folder.   

(Emulators are not guaranteed to work with this demo)
