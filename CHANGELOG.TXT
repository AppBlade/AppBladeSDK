		AppBlade.checkForUpdates(Activity activity)
	 	AppBlade.checkForUpdates(Activity activity, boolean promptForDownload)
	 	AppBlade.checkForUpdatesIgnoreTimeout(Activity activity, boolean promptForDownload)

2013-03-14 	Andrew Tremblay   <andrew.tremblay@raizlabs.com>
	UPDATED CUSTOM PARAM CALL
	* Was -(void)setCustomParam:(id)newObject withValue:(NSString*)key; 
	* Now -(void)setCustomParam:(NSString *)key withValue:(id)value;


2013-03-13 	Andrew Tremblay   <andrew.tremblay@raizlabs.com>
	Added Anonymous Update call. This call sends anonymous information on the current build to AppBlade and checks if there is a newer version available. See documentation/wiki for a walkthrough. 
	* AppBlade.checkForUpdates(Activity activity); in Android
	* [[AppBlade sharedManager] checkForUpdates]; in iOS

	Additional headers added to both Android and iOS sdks.
	* Android now sends a hash of AndroidManifest.xml to better identify it among uploaded versions for anonymous updating.  
	* iOS sends a hash of its info.plist for version identification. 

	Added alternate (i.e. better) session logging implementation for Android. You can now attach session logging as a Service, which tracks the opening and closing of an app more intuitively. It's a bit harder to set up, so it's not the officially suggested method to track sessions. See com.appblade.framework.stats.AppBladeSessionLoggingService in the source code. 


2012-12-03 	Andrew Tremblay  <andrew.tremblay@raizlabs.com>
	Updated iOS Source to be compatible with objective-C++ compilers (app delegates with the .mm suffix were throwing errors when importing AppBlade.h)
	* Appblade.h : UIKIT_EXTERN replaces static in the offensive variables so the compiler knows how to handle them.
	* Appblade.m : removed `static` in the declarations.



2012-11-29 	Andrew Tremblay  <andrew.tremblay@raizlabs.com>

	* CHANGELOG.txt: File Added
