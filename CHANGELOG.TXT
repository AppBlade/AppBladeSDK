	Updated iOS Source to be compatible with objective-C++ compilers (app delegates with the .mm suffix were throwing errors when importing AppBlade.h)
	* Appblade.h : UIKIT_EXTERN replaces static in the offensive variables so the compiler knows how to handle them.
	* Appblade.m : removed `static` in the declarations.
