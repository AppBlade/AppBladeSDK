	Added Anonymous Update call. This call sends anonymous information on the current build to AppBlade and checks if there is a newer version available. See documentation/wiki for a walkthrough. 
	* AppBlade.checkForUpdates(Activity activity); in Android
	* [[AppBlade sharedManager] checkForUpdates]; in iOS

	Additional headers added to both Android and iOS sdks.
	* Android now sends a hash of AndroidManifest.xml to better identify it among uploaded versions for anonymous updating.  
	* iOS sends a hash of its info.plist for version identification. 

	Added alternate (i.e. better) session logging implementation for Android. You can now attach session logging as a Service, which tracks the opening and closing of an app more intuitively. See com.appblade.framework.stats.AppBladeSessionLoggingService in the source code for new implementation. 

2012-12-03 	Andrew Tremblay  <andrew.tremblay@raizlabs.com>
	Updated iOS Source to be compatible with objective-C++ compilers (app delegates with the .mm suffix were throwing errors when importing AppBlade.h)
	* Appblade.h : UIKIT_EXTERN replaces static in the offensive variables so the compiler knows how to handle them.
	* Appblade.m : removed `static` in the declarations.
